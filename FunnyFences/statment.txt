Problem Statement

    	A sequence of characters is called a fence if it consists of alternating '|' and '-' characters, like "|-|-|-|" or "-|-|" (quotes for clarity only). Notice that "|-||-|" or "--" are not fences, because each contains two equal characters adjacent to each other. Given a string s, find the longest consecutive substring of it that is a fence, and return its length.

Examples

0)	
    	
"|-|-|"
Returns: 5
The entire string is a fence.
1)	
    	
"-|-|-|-"
Returns: 7
Still a fence.
2)	
    	
"||||||"
Returns: 1
A fence can be just 1 character long, so every 1 character substring here is a fence.
3)	
    	
"|-||-|-"
Returns: 4
The last 4 characters form the longest consecutive substring that is a fence.
4)	
    	
"|-|---|-|---|-|"
Returns: 5
"-|-|-" right in the middle gives the longest fence.
5)	
    	
"|||-||--|--|---|-||-|-|-|--||---||-||-||-|--||"
Returns: 8
