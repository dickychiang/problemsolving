Problem Statement

A string is considered to be a composite of several maximal segments of identical characters. For example, "aaabbaaac" is a composite of the segments: "aaa", "bb", "aaa" and "c". Given a string, return the average length of all the segments which form that string.

Definition


Class:  StringSegment
Method: average
Parameters: String
Returns:    double
Method signature:   double average(String s)
(be sure your method is public)


Notes

-   A return value with either an absolute or relative error of less than 1.0E-9 is considered correct.

Constraints

-   s will contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.
-   s will contain only lowercase letters ('a'-'z').

Examples

0)  
"aaabbaaac"
Returns: 2.25
Average length of all the segments = ( 3 + 2 + 3 + 1 ) / 4 = 2.25

1)  
"aabbccdd"
Returns: 2.0

2)  
"abba"
Returns: 1.3333333333333333
